# Use Case Scenarios

This repository provides practical networking solutions for secure remote management of MikroTik devices. Below are real-world scenarios where these configurations can be applied.

---

## 1. **Homelab Administrator Managing Devices from Anywhere**

**Context**:  
A network enthusiast runs a homelab with 3 MikroTik nodes (including RB941 and CHR on VirtualBox) behind a residential ISP connection (e.g., IndiHome). The ISP uses CGNAT or restricts inbound ports, making direct remote access impossible.

**Solution**:  
- Use **outbound L2TP/IPsec or SSTP** from the MikroTik to a self-hosted VPS or cloud instance.
- Alternatively, establish an **outbound WireGuard tunnel to tunnel.id** (as shown in `/wireguard-tunnelid/`).
- Access Winbox/WebFig securely via private IP over the tunnel—no public exposure.

**Benefits**:  
✅ No port forwarding required  
✅ Bypasses CGNAT/firewall restrictions  
✅ Full control over homelab from mobile or office

## 2. **IT Support Technician Providing Remote Assistance**

**Context**:  
A freelance IT technician needs to troubleshoot client MikroTik routers located in small offices or retail stores with limited IT staff.

**Solution**:  
- Pre-configure the client’s MikroTik with an **SSTP server** (runs on TCP 443, works behind most firewalls).
- Share temporary VPN credentials to establish a secure session.
- Use Winbox over the encrypted tunnel to diagnose routing, firewall, or bandwidth issues.

**Security Note**:  
- Credentials are rotated after each session.
- Winbox access is restricted to the VPN subnet only (`192.168.99.0/24`).

## 3. **Small Business with Multi-Site Connectivity**

**Context**:  
A small business has a main office (with MikroTik CHR on VPS) and a branch office (RB941). They need secure inter-site communication and centralized management.

**Solution**:  
- Set up **IPsec site-to-site tunnel** between VPS and RB941 (`ipsec-tunnel.rsc`).
- Manage the branch RB941 remotely via the VPS’s internal network.
- Optionally, expose WebFig through an **NGINX reverse proxy** with HTTPS and basic auth (`nginx-reverse-proxy.conf`).

**Outcome**:  
🔒 Encrypted traffic between sites  
🖥️ Centralized monitoring & config backup  
🌐 No dependency on public IP at branch location

## 4. **Portfolio Demonstration for Technical Interviews or Freelance Gigs**

**Context**:  
A network engineer (like you!) wants to showcase hands-on experience with MikroTik, tunneling, and secure remote access.

**How This Repo Helps**:  
- Clean, documented `.rsc` configs ready for review.
- Realistic security practices (firewall rules, service hardening).
- Multiple tunneling methods (L2TP, SSTP, IPsec) compared in one place.
- Ready to deploy in lab or production with minor adjustments.
